<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
	This section will touch on the general workings of the system and configration settings of the server. It will not dive too deep into the areas but may cover some relatively complicated items. This is intended to define the capabilities of the system and highlight some of the functionality. This system is not a basic module or library and acts closer to a web server with a lot of features to help reduce time to stand up of environments.

	The other section of the help documentation will focus on specific functions and advanced usage.
