<h1>System File Layout</h1>
<p>
	The following layout (below) is the general description of each folder and use. Most of the focus will be in the '<blue>web_source</blue>' folder where the projects and website source code is located. The '<blue>web_templates</blue>' is the location of user defined project or website templates if users decide to create base level code (starting points) or fully function web applications. The '<blue>conf</blue>' folder is the location of server configuration and SSL certificate. Log fole '<blue>logs</blue>' is the general location for file logging if the server is set for file based logging. The logs are system, website request and error stack trace logging.
   <br /><br />
   The '<blue>server</blue>' folder doesn't contain any user specific data related to projects. In this location, you can choose manually add templates to the '<blue>default_templates</blue>' folder which are similar to the user defined templates, basic file types in '<blue>default_file_types</blue>' can be modified which are used by the Project Files 'Add' function. Lastly, modify the '<blue>default_system</blue>' error and maintenance pages if there is a preference for those to look a certain way (if not using custmer error pages for websites).
