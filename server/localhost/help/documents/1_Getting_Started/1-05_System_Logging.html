<h1>System Logging</h1>
<h3>File Based Logging</h3>
<p>
    When the system is set for file based logging, the following types of files are created and stored as per the server configuration settings. By default, the start up of the server will create the base configuration which is file logging for 7 days of retention. There are 2 types of files which is a text ".log" file which is only the log message. The ".json" file contains a lot more details. The ".json" file has a JSON string per line so is not meant to be opened as one large file. This is done for performacne reasons. Multiple servers should leverage a log server to centrailize logging.

<h3>Server Based Logging</h3>
<p>
See the 'Server Settings' page for more details, the following would be an example of a log server. Changes to the configuration will need a server restart. <b>NOTE</b>: All server based logging is only in JSON format.
</p>
<pre>
    {
       "use": "<hl>server</hl>",
       "file": {
          "delete_older": "7d"
       },
       "server": {
          "ipaddr": "<hl>192.168.1.95</hl>",
          "port": "<hl>514</hl>",
          "protocol": "<hl>udp</hl>"
       }
    }
</pre>

<h3>JSON Log Detail Example (request or error logs)</h3>
<p>
    The following is a formatted JSON error log from '<blue>project_name</blue>' and '<blue>website_name</blue>' as an example. This is very similar to a request log with the difference that there is an additional field of '<hl>stack_trace</hl>' for capturing the fault itself in code. The common JSON field data contains a lot of detail about the server process and version, what project and website, state, error code, request and client details, time in milliseconds, and some matching logic of how the server matched the incoming request. Highlighted below is the stack trace example.

<p>
    Extracted from the log above, a stack trace will contain the problem and location of the errors for any back end coding gone wrong. This is aimed at helping the development of applications and not having to worry too much about building in logging within the application itself if one needs to do so.

<h3>Match Log Details</h3>
<p>
    In addition to normal logging of the request, there is also a '<blue>match_log</blue>' field that will contain the process of the system matching logic. If there are any issues and unsure why a website is not loading, this might help give some insight into why a website or content might be having some troubles.
