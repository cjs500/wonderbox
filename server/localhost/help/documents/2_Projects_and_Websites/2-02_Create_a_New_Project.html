	<b>1-</b> Create a new project, click the <img src="../../../images/box_icon.png" alt="" /> in the top menu bar to begin.
	<br /><br />
	<b>2-</b> When first building a project on a new system, the 'Create from system or user template' will be grayed out. These are available when there are project templates that can be used to start from. Fill in the 'Project Name' with a desired name. The 'Project Description' is optional. This name will become the project folder name in the '<blue>web_source</blue>' folder. Project names are limited to alphanumeric, dot '.', dash '-', and underscore '_' character and in lower case to ensure no filesystem problems occur. Windows and Linux/UNIX system treat lower case and upper case differently. In Linux/UNIX systems, folders and files by the same name with upper and lower case letters are different folders or files. In windows, upper and lower case letters will resolve to the same folder or file. This can be dangerous when working on source code on differnt platforms; especially when copying code from Windows to Linux/UNIX and vice versa.
