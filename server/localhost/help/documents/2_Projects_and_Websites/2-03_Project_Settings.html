<h1>Project Settings</h1>
<p>
	Selecting the project in the 'Projects' navigation tree will expand the project and provide two sub selections for 'Websites' and 'Project Files'. These sections are for adding new websites, some settings, and viewing or some basic management of folder and files. 
	<br /><br />
	The right panel allows for changes to the 'Project Description', 'Enabled' toggles to enable or disable the project, and the status of the configuration file (currently a green check mark). The 'Enabled' setting at this point does not do anything with no websites and Proxy or DNS mapping. That would be used at a later time.
	<br /><br />
	The 'Project Files' has some file creation helpers like creating some pre-defined HTML, CSS, or API files. For future reference, API files are built to work with this system so it is a good idea to use them to start working with server side execution and coding.
