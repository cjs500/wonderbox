<h1>General Settings</h1>
<p>
	This section is for general defaults and actions like '<blue>SSL Redirect</blue>' and '<blue>Maintenance Mode</blue>' checkboxes, settings for a '<blue>Default Document</blue>', '<blue>Maintenance Page</blue>' for user and API responses, and '<blue>Error Pages</blue>' for user or API responses.

	'<blue>SSL Redirect</blue>' checkbox will make a client browser redirect from HTTP to HTTPS. If using a load balancer in front of a web service to do any sort of SSL offload, where the website is HTTP and load balancer is HTTPS, this setting you may want to turn off as it can potentially cause issues. This may be done for performance reasons. It is usually best to SSL secure the website communcation end to end to make most security departments happier. This would mean the load balancer will handle SSL and and communicate to web service over SSL.

	'<blue>Default Document</blue>' textbox is typically '<blue>index.html</blue>' for when connecting to the root of the website (like '<blue>https://www.domain.com/</blue>'). If there is no file specified at the end of the address, the server will add the default document. This is the same for any static content sub folder where a filename is not specified, the server will use the default document here. If there are no default documents in a static content sub folder location, it will set a 404 page (either a custom one or system default). The default document doesn't need to be an HTML file. You can choose for it to be a JSON, XML, or other type if creating an API only websute. It can also be setup as an API type file. Any default document with a '<blue>.js</blue>' file extension will automatically be treated as server side execution.
	<br /><br />
	'<blue>Maintenance Mode (per Environment)</blue>' checkboxes is used to set a website into maintenance mode. These boxes are settings per environment (See '<b>Environments</b>' in '<b>Getting Started</b>' section for more details). If having a setup where all environments connect to the same web source, you can toggle this setting to put different environments into maintenance mode from a management server (like this one). This does not apply to VHost preview (a Website preview) since the preview gives a user an ability to verify the website before taking it out of maintenance mode. The website user, viewing through a Proxy or DNS FQDN mapping, will see a maintenance page when toggled on.
	<br /><br />
	For '<blue>Maintenance Page</blue>' and '<blue>Error Pages</blue>' textboxes, there are defaults for user or an API response. The reason there is a '<blue>User Response</blue>' and an '<blue>API Response</blue>' field is for how the server will respond to those mapping settings when setting static content or server side execute mappings. If a user is connecting to a website for static content, the expected response is most likely an HTML file. If a server or client application makes an API call, a typical response might be expected in JSON format or some other data format, you can set a default JSON file or other file type as the response so that the format is recognizable to the server or client API request. This can help remove errors that might occur for server requests or client API calls. The fields will accept most HTML or data file type extensions so give some flexibility on how you set them up.
