<h1>Project Files</h1>
<p>
	The following is a brief description of the '<blue>Project Files</blue>' panel. The following sections is used for basic file operations like add folder, add file template types, delete files, viewing content:
</p>
<ul class="num">
	<li class="num">Create folder, file template types, delete selected folder or file</li>
	<li class="num">The folder and file browser inside of the project folder</li>
	<li class="num">The file viewer for selected file</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Icons in the viewers that have a lock on them are due to the website mapping settings for things like default document, maintenance and error page settings, API mapping settings. The system attempts to protect some of the files related to what is in the configuration file. The lower view is a viewer for looking at the contents of select files. This example is viewing the configuration file that was created during project and website creation steps which is in JSON format.
