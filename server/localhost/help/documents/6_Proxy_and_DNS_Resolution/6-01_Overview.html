<h1>Overview</h1>
<h3>Manageing Resolution</h3>
<p>
	There are two locations for managing the project website resolution. Selecting '<blue>Resolve</blue>' from the left tree navigation and from the project '<blue>Website</blue>' panel when you have a selected project. The main '<blue>Resolve</blue>' panel is where you create '<blue>Proxy Map</blue>' or '<blue>DNS FQDN</blue>' mapping types and the project '<blue>Websites</blue>' panel is for changing the mapping assignments to environments or websites in the project.
</p>
<br />
<h3>URL Assignments</h3>
<p>
    Before assigning URL addresses to a project and website, the network administrator must first configure a local or external DNS to resolve domain names to an IP address of your web server, load balancer or proxy server VIP (virtual IP). Kubernetes ingress service may also need setting for domain resolution to the service IP. If you are working on a local workstation, you may choose to modify the local hosts file to resolve a domain name to you localhost IP address. This is needed before you can get any URL mapping to work with your project websites.
    <br /><br />
    The system aims to have projects and it's website configurations decoupled from the server as much as possible so that the projects are portable and easily moved from one environment to another. That means that there are no '<blue>Proxy Map</blue>' or '<blue>DNS FQDN</blue>' mapping at the server configuration level at all. Any URL assignments are configured in the project configuration files which are centrally managed in the Management UI. A challenge with this is keeping track of the URL assignments if you have multiple environments with Management UIs enabled but each environment cannot see all the projects, or users are configured with limited access to projects and cannot see all the mappings. It would be recommended to have a single repository with all projects so an environment with a Managment UI enbled can see all projects and URL assignments for all environments.
    <br /><br />
    A caveat to keep in mind, when deleting a project that has any '<blue>Proxy Map</blue>' or '<blue>DNS FQDN</blue>' map settings, those mappings will delete with the project. If you don't want to re-enter them, re-assign them to a different project and then delete the project.
    <br /><br />
    You can create assignments for different URLs to a project and website in different environments Dev, QA (Test), Stage and Prod. The server will read the project configurations and map only the URLs pertaining to the local environment setting of the server. If you have a server set for Dev environment, that server will only map the Dev '<blue>Proxy Map</blue>' or '<blue>DNS FQDN</blue>' mappings. If moving that project folder to a server with a QA environment setting, that server will map only the URLs assigned for QA environments.

<h3>Mapping Types</h3>
<p>
    <b>Proxy Map</b> types are a format of '<blue>www.domain.com/path</blue>' where URL of domain + path maps to a project website.<br />
    <b>DNS FQDN</b> types are a format of '<blue>www.domain.com</blue>' where URL of domain name only maps to a project website.<br />
    <br />
    '<blue>Proxy Map</blue>' types will match first before '<blue>DNS FQDN</blue>'. It is possible to create a '<blue>DNS FQDN</blue>' map to a domain name that is also used for '<blue>Proxy Map</blue>' with a folder path. That would allow for the FQDN to map to a primary website and proxy mapping to resolve a folder to another project website.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Resolve Panel</h3>
<p>
    The '<blue>Resolve</blue>' panel has two table views showing the mapping. The top table is only for '<blue>Proxy Map</blue>' and '<blue>DNS FQDN</blue>' mapping settings. The second table is for listing VHost preview links for all projects and websites as a quick reference. The second view is not used for managing VHosts, they are generated automatically when a project and websites are created on a server with the Management UI enabled. It's there for ability to view the websites and also an index of what currently exists in the web source folder.
    <br /><br />
    This panel allows for configuring new URLs to resolve to project, map type, environment, and the target website. For existing mapping, it allows for changing what project the URL belongs to and also to change environment and website target.

<h3>Project Websites Panel</h3>
<p>
    The project websites panel has a quick reference, quick settings, VHost preview and any '<blue>Proxy Map</blue>' or '<blue>DNS FQDN</blue>' map settings assigned to the project. The mapping settings panel allows a local project admin to modify what environment or website a URL is configured for. It may not make sense to move the environment but you may have decided to clone a website and work on development changes. You can select the new cloned website for the dev environment and not affect the settings for the other environments.
