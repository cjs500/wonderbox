<h1>Template System Overview</h1>
<p>
    When starting new projects, sharing completed projects (fully functional applications), modules, micro services, etc. users will probably use GitHub, Gitea or some code repo for deploying new code. Templates can be an alternative to that or in combination with templates. You can have a base project template and create a new project from a template and then choose to push the project to a code repo. It can also be used as a migration tool to move websites from ones project to another where a user exports a website to a template and then adds a website from a template to another project.
    <br /><br />
    As it functions currently, you can choose to create a full project tempalte or select one or more websites as the template types. Full projects contain all the files in a project folder and website just the files in a website folder.
    <br /><br />
    Templates are very close to what a project configuration and files are. The system basically strips out the mapping sections and stores only a description with website configuration settings.
    <br /><br />
    In the sections for creating a project and creating a website have steps on how to create from a template so will not repeat this here. This section will show where to create, remove them, the location of the templates, and some other details about them.
