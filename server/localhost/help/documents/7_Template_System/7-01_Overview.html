<h1>Template System Overview</h1>
<p>
    When starting new projects, sharing completed projects (fully functional applications), modules, micro services, and static websites you can leverage the templating functionality of this system. You can mix with a code repo like GitHub where you can push or pull a template from a repo and deploy locally to create new projects. It can also be used as a migration tool to move websites from ones project to another where a user exports a website to a template and then adds a website from a template to another project.
    <br /><br />
    As it functions currently, you can choose to create a full project tempalte or select one or more websites as the template types. Full projects contain all the files in a project folder and website just the files in a website folder.
    <br /><br />
    In the sections for creating a project and creating a website have steps on how to create from a template so will not repeat this here. This section will show where to create, remove them, the location of the templates, and some other details about them.
