<h1>Defualt System Templates</h1>
<p>
    The default system templates cannot be added and removed from the Management UI. If there is some reason to remove all access from add, remove or changing a template, you can leverage the default system directory.

<p>
    In the server folder there is a '<blue>default_templates</blue>' folder that contains the pre-installed templates. These are exactly the same as the user defined ones. You can create either type and moved them between the '<blue>web_templates</blue>' folder and the '<blue>default_templates</blue>' folder. If you want to get rid of all default ones and replace with your own and allow users to freely control the user defined templates, this is a way to accomplish this.
