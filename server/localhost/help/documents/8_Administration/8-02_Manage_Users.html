<h1>Manage Users</h1>
<p>
   User management and access control to project and website settings can be configured from this panel. From a fresh install, the only user is the 'admin'. At the current time the user management is local to this Management UI. There is no ties in with SSO or LDAP services at the current time. Current user management is good for small groups or simple access control to login to the Management UI.
